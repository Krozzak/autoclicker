# Roadmap - Grid Auto-Clicker

Future improvements and feature ideas for the project.

## Grid Enhancements

### Custom Grid Layouts
- [ ] Allow non-rectangular grids (skip certain positions)
- [ ] Import/export grid configurations
- [ ] Multiple named grid presets

### Click Patterns
- [ ] **Traversal direction options:**
  - Left-to-right (current default)
  - Right-to-left
  - Top-to-bottom
  - Bottom-to-top
  - Zigzag (snake pattern)
- [ ] **Advanced patterns:**
  - Spiral (inside-out or outside-in)
  - Circular pattern
  - Random order
  - Custom sequence (user-defined order)

### Grid Preview Improvements
- [ ] Better visualization of Click Spread zones (show ±random_offset_px area)
- [ ] Better visualization of Offset DX/DY effect
- [ ] Animated preview showing click sequence
- [ ] Mini-map with actual screen coordinates
- [ ] Highlight current position during execution

## Timing Improvements

### Advanced Timing
- [ ] Per-position timing overrides
- [ ] Adaptive timing based on CPU load
- [ ] Timing profiles for different applications

### Timeline Visualization
- [ ] Interactive timeline (click to adjust)
- [ ] Show actual timing variance from jitter
- [ ] Overlay real execution timing vs configured

## Counter/Economy Enhancements

### Statistics
- [ ] Session history (save past runs)
- [ ] Export statistics to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Graphs showing profit over time

### Goals
- [ ] Multiple goal types (time-based, profit-based, cycle-based)
- [ ] Goal notifications (sound, popup)
- [ ] Scheduled stops (run until X time)

## Dashboard Improvements

### Real-time Stats
- [ ] Clicks per second graph
- [ ] Cycle time variance chart
- [ ] Heat map of clicked positions

### Notifications
- [ ] Sound alerts for milestones
- [ ] System tray notifications
- [ ] Discord/webhook integration

## UI/UX

### Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all controls
- [ ] High contrast theme
- [ ] Larger font option

### Quality of Life
- [ ] Minimize to system tray
- [ ] Global hotkey customization
- [ ] Multi-monitor support (preview on different screens)
- [ ] Profile system (save/load complete configurations)

## Technical Improvements

### Performance
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint
- [ ] Optimize preview rendering
- [ ] Lazy loading for large grids

### Reliability
- [ ] Auto-recovery from errors
- [ ] Backup state file
- [ ] Logging to file for debugging

## Priority Legend

Potential next priorities based on user impact:

1. **High Impact**: Click patterns (traversal direction), Grid preview improvements
2. **Medium Impact**: Session history, Goal notifications, Profile system
3. **Nice to Have**: Advanced patterns (spiral/circular), Graphs, Webhook integration
